1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:03,273
Bella, Gloria, love.

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:03,855
Oh.

3
00:00:04,496 --> 00:00:06,219
How are you?

4
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:07,126
Oh, I'm OK.

5
00:00:08,412 --> 00:00:08,915
I will be.

6
00:00:09,215 --> 00:00:10,439
I said she could stay with us tomorrow

7
00:00:10,459 --> 00:00:11,351
just until she feels better.

8
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:11,954
Yeah.

9
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,238
Of course she can.

10
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,012
No, things won't be for long.

11
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,338
Well, you can stay as long as you want, my love.

12
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:18,810
I've really missed you.

13
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:19,795
Pops.

14
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,679
Great to see you, love.

15
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,213
Oh.

16
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:24,378
All right, shall we get you off to bed then?

17
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,052
You should have given me some warm.

18
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:26,494
I know.

19
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:28,940
I'll have to put the electric blanket on.

20
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:29,817
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,633
All right, Bella.

22
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:31,897
Freezing up there.

23
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:33,647
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

24
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,533
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

25
00:00:38,135 --> 00:00:39,296
Do you want your PJs?

26
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:40,181
Yeah.

27
00:00:42,388 --> 00:00:43,773
Lifting a bundle of pajamas,

28
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:45,876
Peter finds a sheet of paper labeled

29
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,249
Lancaster North Hospital discharge sheet.

30
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,856
He closes the suitcase and brings Gloria the pajamas.

31
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:54,831
There you go.

32
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:55,895
Thank you.

33
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:56,742
He picks up the locket.

34
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:57,627
You kept it.

35
00:00:58,874 --> 00:00:59,960
Oh, of course.
