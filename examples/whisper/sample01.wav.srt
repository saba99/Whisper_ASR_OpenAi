1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Bella, Gloria, love.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Oh.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, I'm OK.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I will be.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I said she could stay with us tomorrow

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
just until she feels better.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Of course she can.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, things won't be for long.

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, you can stay as long as you want, my love.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've really missed you.

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Pops.

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Great to see you, love.

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh.

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right, shall we get you off to bed then?

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You should have given me some warm.

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I know.

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll have to put the electric blanket on.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
All right, Bella.

22
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Freezing up there.

23
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In a bedroom, Peter unpacks her suitcase.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The middle-aged woman opens her green case.

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Do you want your PJs?

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah.

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Lifting a bundle of pajamas, Peter finds a sheet of paper

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
labeled Lancaster North Hospital discharge sheet.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He closes the suitcase and brings Gloria the pajamas.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There you go.

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you.

33
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He picks up the locket.

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He kept it.

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, cool.
